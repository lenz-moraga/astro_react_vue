# Astro React Vue

This is a demo project showcasing the integration of UI frameworks like React and Vue within the Astro.js ecosystem, utilizing Nano Stores for state management and TailwindCSS for styling. This project serves as a practical example of creating a product list in React, adding items to a shopping cart implemented in Vue, and leveraging Nano Stores for shared state management across different framework components ("islands").
